"Learning how to Learn"

This is a one-page website pet-project completed as part of the web development course at Practicum.

The project's goal is to apply and practice the skills of web page layout using HTML and CSS.

The following technologies were used:

HTML - page markup was created, including the use of semantic tags.
CSS - the visual design of the page content was created, including the use of the following tools:
2.1. Various properties for positioning blocks and elements;
2.2. Flexbox;
2.3. Embedded media files (iframes);
2.4. Basic transformations and animation.
The project's file structure is organized using the BEM technology, which allows for the painless use of blocks in other projects.
